# Elevator Panel (UI-Challenege)

## UI Requirements:
- A display panel that indicates the number of the current floor
Green and red lights indicating whether the elevator is going up (green) or down (red)
- Four floor buttons
- Four floors behind the elevator panel, represented as images you select from any free source on the internet
## Functional Requirements:
- A floor can be selected from the elevator panel.
- When a floor is selected, its button is highlighted.
- Clicking on a floor button in the panel will cause the floors in the background to scroll up and down.
- Multiple floors can be selected and will be executed in the order that they were selected.
- The chosen button should remain highlighted until the floor is reached.
- The current floor is shown on the display panel. (This is the large number on the panel display.)
- The elevator's current direction (up/down) is indicated by highlighting the corresponding green and red indicators in the display panel.
- A visual cue is provided when you have arrived at the selected floor. (Un-highlight the button, deactivate the direction indicators, and update the displayed floor.)
- Selecting a button anchor does not navigate or change the URL.
